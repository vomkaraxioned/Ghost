I recalled being fascinated to find out how the game was built (in a very general/vague way) by digging into their asset files to find —guess what .. sprites! — using which they were able to stitch them together to animate the characters — their movements, actions/interactions and skills.\n\nI know this is not exactly the same thing — and I’m not getting into animating sprites or any similar use cases in this post. Why I delved into that is to share the observation that a lot of what we see as trending in the recent years around SVGs, symbol sprites and SVG animations is not too different in principle to how game developers have done things in the past.\n\n\nGetting into it\n\nI came across a neat little base package called eleventastic by Max Böck which already checked most of the boxes of what I was discussing/hearing on the call.\n\nEDIT: Max’s repo now uses eleventy-plugin-svg-sprite to generate the sprite instead, which is cool — but I’ve kept (and not updated) his original solution in the post so that folks can understand the underlying working of something like this.\n\nSo I started off by forking the repo and then tried to understand how the author had configured all the SVGs in the src/assets/icons directory to be bundled into a symbol sprite file. Neat!\n\nThen the SVG filename will then be used as the symbol identifier and the icon can be used as a shortcode in your templates or as a direct xlink:href. This is where the magic happens!\n\nI expanded upon the icon type from Max and added logo which accepts width and height and colorlogo which accepts width , heightand fill (to add color to shape).\n\n\nIn action\n\n * Now go ahead and add new SVGs into src/assets/icons folder\n * Use shortcodes (logo, icon, colorlogo) and pass the necessary parameters to render to get shapes be rendered from your symbol sprite.\n\n{% icon \"wheel\" %}\n\n{% logo \"hammer\", \"75\", \"75\" %}\n\n{% colorlogo \"wheel\", \"150\", \"150\", \"purple\" %}\n\n * You can also directly use the shape like below.\n\n<svg><use xlink:href=\"#icon-github\" fill=\"#dd0000\"></use></svg>\n\n * Save and rebuild (if you are not already running in locally using npm start (which will auto-refresh your browser)\n\nOnce the rebuild is done, you should see something like the below screenshot 🙂\n\nNote: You can extend this further if you like by passing the fill value from your CSS stylesheets instead of inline (like I did in the example below). Check reference links at the bottom to find out more on how to do that.\n\nAppreciate any feedback and/or suggestions any might have on what I have shared here. Again, a big thank you to Max for his base code package which was super clear, simple, and easy to follow/expand upon — even for a newbie coder like me.\n\nSource code:\n\nThis is by no means production ready and I’m sure there are ways to improve and further optimize the workflow. The goal of this exercise is to act more as a proof of concept or a hack on how to put this together for some additional use cases (which may or may not be your requirement).\n\nbanuragprdxn/eleventastic\nA simple Eleventy Starter Kit, my base for all new 11ty projects.

Using a custom event in this case would allow you to get the total amount of time for all page loads of the previous page (from all visitors/visits).\n\nYou would need create a calculated metric to get the average page load time for each page which should look something like this:\n\n\nRead more\n\nSome really great and helpful resources:\n\n * The Hard Truth About Measuring Page Load Time by Josh West on Analytics Demystified\n * Measuring Site Speed in Adobe Analytics by Ben Gaines on Adobe Blog\n * How to Classify Page Load Time in Adobe Analytics on OurPcGeek\n * Classification Rule Builder workflow on Adobe Experience League","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/downloaded_images/Tracking-Site-Speed-in-Adobe-Analytics---The-Quick-Way/0-Q5iNk5QHvW0IxL0Y","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-06-20 00:00:00","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2021-06-20 00:00:00","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2021-06-20 00:00:00","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":"\nA quick way to start tracking site speed performance of your web properties along with the rest of your Adobe Analytics data.\n","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://medium.com/@imanuragbanerjee/tracking-site-speed-in-adobe-analytics-the-quick-way-a9393fb842b1","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"651d2982cc078835d6c150ae","uuid":"f6b81766-0159-442a-977e-035f1a826ec4","title":"Weeknotes 24–2021","slug":"weeknotes-24-2021","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/downloaded_images/Weeknotes-24-2021/0-SrrDz-OUCSH7_4b_\",\"caption\":\"Pexels\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/downloaded_images/Weeknotes-24-2021/0-pdRVtXMlfgvK3e5W\",\"caption\":\"Not the most appetizing picture but I can vouch for the taste!\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"em\"],[\"strong\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.pexels.com/@thngocbich?utm_content=attributionCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=pexels\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/black-graphing-paper-913116/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=pexels\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.stoicroutine.com/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://sleepyowl.co/\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Hello and thank you for stumbling on this.

It brings various tools together into an integrated workflow that allows people to spend their time doing what they love.\n\nJam from Jamstack is an abbreviation for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. Javascript for the dynamic functionalities, APIs for connecting to third-party services (like payment gateways, lead gen/CRM tools, etc), and Markup is your website’s statically served assets (HTML, CSS, JS).\n\nThe idea is: Businesses don’t have to worry as much about scalability or maintenance, Engineers get to use a modern toolset that helps improve efficiency, Marketers benefit from fast-to-market, and users appreciate the speed/performance of the digital experiences.\n\n\nWhy Jamstack?\n\n\nPerformance and scale\n\nEverything that the user sees (the front end) is generated beforehand and is done so usually in a highly optimized static format and assets.\n\nWhen the user hits your website, they don’t have to wait for the server to compute/calculate or generate the page first — they are directly served to the user in a format that your browser can readily use.\n\nThese are often served from a Content Distribution Network (CDN) like Cloudflare, Amazon CloudFront, Fastly, etc. which are geographically distributed networks optimized (including but not limited to caching) to serve assets to users from a location closest to the user which improves the web performance of your site.\n\nBonus: As your site is pre-generated, you chose or move from one provider to another without having to worry too much about lock-ins and migration hell 😅. All modern static site generators work on the same principle, i.e., pre-rendering.\n\n\nSecurity and maintenance\n\nWhen your files are pre-built and hosted on read-only hosts and served through a CDN, there isn’t really a lot for an attacker to do. Jamstack aims to remove or reduce the need to set up or maintain a dedicated server to host your website.\n\nAnd since this is It is static-first, once your website is generated and deployed on the static host or served through a CDN, you don’t need a dedicated team to keep your website running.\n\nHosting static files is cheaper than what it would take for dedicated hosting (and still cheaper in most cases as compared to shared hosting — which you should not use for product-level sites anyway).\n\nYou and your team can focus on what matters the most — the business and the users.\n\n\nDecoupled\n\ndecouple (verb): separate, disengage, or dissociate (something) from something else.\n\nEverything that you use has a specific and specialized purpose. You can choose to have best-in-class front-end tooling and a tried/tested backend/admin experience (connected via APIs) and so on.\n\nFor anything more complex, you can emulate server-like capabilities by leveraging serverless functions which allow you to write and execute more complex processes without the need for a dedicated system or a team to keep it up. Hosting providers like Netlify, Vercel, and many others do it for you. You trigger the function from your static site, and they will do the rest.\n\n\nSome use cases\n\n * Marketing/landing pages: Your statically generated front-end pushes leads/data to your CRM tool of choice (like HubSpot, Salesforce, etc). With quick development, faster performance, at a fraction of the infrastructure cost for traditional hosting.\n * Marketing teams and content-heavy sites: You can benefit from giving your Marketing team flexibility to use a tool of their choice. You can use Contentful, Sanity, Strapi, or even a decoupled WordPress — giving your content and marketing team the comfort of using a toolset they trust and enabling your Engineering team to use modern tooling which helps with faster development cycles. Best of both worlds.\n * Serverless for advanced users: You can even have fully functional web applications which can do almost everything that a server can do — minus the security/infrastructure cost of setting up and maintaining. With cloud functions (which are supported by most modern web hosts), you can run the computation.\n\n\nWhere are people using this today?\n\nAccording to the Jamstack Community Survey 2020–2021, the top 5 business application of Jamstack has been in the following spaces:\n\n * B2B software\n * E-commerce\n * Consumer software\n * Informational\n * Lead capture/landing pages\n\nAnd the industries that saw these applied the most are (no surprises here):\n\n * Advertising and marketing\n * Education\n * Finance and financial services\n * Media publishing\n * Business support and logistics\n\n\nWhere do I get started\n\nIf you are like me, you’d probably have bought into the idea of Jamstack. I mean, why not? Shorter time to market, improved performance, not having to worry about lock-ins, reduced costs to maintain the sites. That all sounds good. But what the heck do I do? where do I start? There are so many options, frameworks, and tools! 🤔\n\nWhat has worked for us and many of the businesses that we have worked for is to start with a “proof of concept”. You are not really trying to prove the concept of Jamstack; instead, it is to prove (or evaluate) how applicable or valuable is that to your business in real-life.\n\nTake a simplified version of your current problem statement, set up a minimalist version of the workflow, get your business users to try it out, get feedback. You will start to see a difference in the speed at which your team can build things and deploy changes.\n\nFrom a content/data source perspective, Markdown is probably the easiest to get started with at this stage. At this point, what you want to see is if this workflow of decoupled, pre-generated, ship and forget architecture is something that will create value for your business. Later on, you can plugin in external headless CMS solutions like Contentful, Strapi, Keystone, Sanity, and more.\n\nYou could go for something as simple as Next.js or Gatsby which are among the most widely used static site generators (SSG). If you and your team are not familiar with React or other frameworks (like Vue, which has Gridsome and many more), you can start with 11ty which has a low barrier to entry.\n\nWe started with 11ty + Nunjucks / Handlebars + Markdown, with hosting/deployment managed by Netlify a couple of years back. The key is to start simple.\n\nNow, in addition to the above, we frequently use Gatsby, Next.js, Contentful, Strapi, Contentstack, and Netlify hosting (with the options to preview builds before you merge, making it very easy for quality control and much much more; and no, not a sponsored post, just a happy customer).\n\nJust head on over Jamstack.org — look for site generators and headless CMSs and start tinkering. Best of luck with your adventures 🚀.\n\nIf you or your team are interested in exploring this further then feel free to give us a shout.\n\n","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/downloaded_images/What-is-Jamstack---for-everyone-else-/1-n0rMtkEH7koLvDrQWBE_WQ-1.jpeg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-12-16 00:00:00","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2021-12-16 00:00:00","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2021-12-16 00:00:00","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":"\nYou have probably had the word “Jamstack” being thrown at you many times, but what does that really mean? and where do you even get…\n","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://medium.com/@imanuragbanerjee/what-is-jamstack-for-everyone-else-c2bb1b2e9682","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"651d2982cc078835d6c150b7","uuid":"83a6ccee-ee0d-4a1f-841a-be4aefd61522","title":"Weeknotes 49–2021","slug":"weeknotes-49-2021","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/downloaded_images/Weeknotes-49-2021/1-p9qBMe9Wql3Vx0f3tpcPOA.jpeg\",\"caption\":\"Pexels\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/downloaded_images/Weeknotes-49-2021/1-6eeEmnoruEPZ4nNHeY4AyQ.png\",\"caption\":\"10069 hours = 420 days = 14 months = 1.16 years; 13% of my life since March 2013.\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"em\"],[\"strong\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://github.com/features/issues\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#applied-visual-design\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#applied-accessibility\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#responsive-web-design-principles\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.pexels.com/@danny-meneses-340146?utm_content=attributionCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=pexels\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/photo-of-turned-on-laptop-computer-943096/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=pexels\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg1qbkG0KRI\"]]],\"sections\":[[3,\"ul\",[[[0,[],0,\"The \"],[0,[2],1,\"new GitHub project planning capabilities\"],[0,[],0,\" (currently in Beta) just got rolled out to our organization, so that has been something I’ve been playing around last week.

Crain Communications’ own personnel were then freed up to break ground on other projects.\n\nPRDXN strove to better understand and serve Crain’s needs through a policy of open and humanized communication. This increase in quality manpower allowed for enhanced development of website features along with more thorough debugging.\n\nWith the infrastructure in place and any potential geographical/cultural issues sorted out, Crain’s Scrum Masters were free to use PRDXN personnel as their own. This increase in quality manpower allowed for enhanced development of website features along with more thorough debugging. PRDXN’s strategy was so efficient, they were able to close out an additional Drupal-based event website that the NYC team wouldn’t have been able to produce on their own.\n\n","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2017-12-20 00:00:00","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2017-12-20 00:00:00","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2017-12-20 00:00:00","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":"\nIn a launch-obsessed business culture, projects that lose steam and crash back down to Earth are an all too common occurrence.

Here are some of the things that we, at PRDXN, are HYPED about:\n\nReact VR\n\n * Anybody with experience in building React apps should be able to build React VR apps pretty easily\n * React VR allows developers to build 360-degree virtual reality experiences with the help of JavaScript\n * Sweet! React combined with Virtual Reality! We (PRDXN) have been working with React for about 2 years now. So we’re damn excited that Facebook is using React to build Virtual Reality experiences. Woot woot!\n\nFacebook Spaces (VR — Virtual Reality)\n\n * Oculus Rift + Facebook = 3D virtual hangout with friends\n * More than chat messages; it brings voice and avatar body language\n * WILL expand to other VR platforms\n\nWhat we (PRDXN) love about this…Facebook’s cracked the “human experience” again without any (?!?) warning. Firstly, they brought us a social platform we didn’t even know we wanted or would enjoy. Now there’s this…\n\nAs humans, part of what we love about being with each other is observing things together, and sharing our observations, impressions, analysis, etc. on what we’ve jointly observed — i.e., seeing the Eiffel Tower for the first time with your best bud, etc. This is what Facebook Spaces is all about.\n\nCamera Effects Platform (AR — Augmented Reality)\n\n * Facebook copying Snapchat? No, they’re just getting started\n * Opens up Facebook’s “AR Studio” to the developer community, unlike Snapchat (come on, share!)\n * Wearables still need time to evolve/reach customers; cameras are already there!\n * Facebook: ‘We want to make cameras the first augmented reality platform’\n\n…Got to this point and confused as to how Augmented Reality differs from Virtual Reality? Then check this out.\n\nReact Fiber\n\n * Incoming React 16, will be a rewrite of React based on their learnings with emphasis on extensibility\n * “We wanted to start with a new foundation that could power everything we do going forward” says Ben Alpert\n * Designed to improve React’s suitability in areas such as animation, layout and gestures\n * Fully backwards compatible with existing React-based applications and Facebook is confident that this would not be a problem; still something for Developers to keep an eye out for\n\nRelay Modern\n\n * New version of Relay, used for building data-heavy applications\n * Rewritten for performance and extensibility, same as React Fiber\n * Simplifies the API, adds features and improves performance; more here\n\nOther highlights:\n\n * Litho — declarative UI framework for Android, already in use in Facebook’s Android app\n * 360-degree Cameras: Paving the way for future of VR by enabling content creators\n * Bots for Facebook Workplace, adds file integration, partners its way into enterprise-grade compliance\n * Brain-computer interface: Detects you speaking silently in your head, and translates it into text; all this without invasive implants\n * If Brain-computer interface sounds too futuristic, here comes skin-hearing (!?) — ability to hear through the skin\n * Instagram gets offline mode for Android, coming soon for iOS\n * Updates to Facebook Analytics, Facebook Login and Facebook Account Kit","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2017-04-21 00:00:00","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2017-04-21 00:00:00","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2017-04-21 00:00:00","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":"\nFacebook’s F8 2017 conference is over now and there is a lot to takeaway from it.
